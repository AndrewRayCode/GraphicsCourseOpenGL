It would be great if there were diagrams overlapped with the code typing,
like when talking about reflecting light in the fragment shader, having
some drawings interleaved with the code would be helpful.

A general issue is talking while typing / while the user is typing. When
following along with the course there's a lot of code writing for the student,
but often by the time we write the code the instructor is talking about something
different, so it can be easy to lose context or place and have to puase and
skip backwards.
